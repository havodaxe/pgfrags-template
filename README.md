Python/pygame fragment shader boilerplate

The bulk of this was copied from:
https://bitbucket.org/Mekire/gltut-python-pygame-pyopengl/

02_playing_with_colors/02_FragPosition.py and its dependencies were
modified to provide a single screen-covering rectangle for drawing and
uniforms for time and resolution.
